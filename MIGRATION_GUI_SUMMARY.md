## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
MigrationGUI (main class)

│   ├── Path Configuration
│   ├── Format Selection
│   ├── Export Execution (threaded)
│   └── Progress Logging
├── Import Tab
│   ├── File Selection
│   ├── Qdrant Configuration
│   ├── Connection Testing
│   ├── Import Execution (threaded)
│   └── Verification

```

### Threading Model
- Main UI thread remains responsive
- Export/Import operations run in background threads
- Thread-safe logging queue for real-time updates
- Proper error handling across thread boundaries

### Data Flow

**Export Flow**:
1. User configures paths and formats
2. GUI reads ChromaDB collections
3. Data serialized to JSON and/or Pickle
4. Statistics generated
5. Import guide created
6. Completion notification

**Import Flow**:
1. User selects export file
2. GUI connects to Qdrant
3. Export file validated
4. Collection created in Qdrant
5. Vectors uploaded in batches
6. Verification performed
7. Test search executed
8. Completion notification

### Configuration Management
- Settings stored in `~/.nerdbuntu_migration_config.json`
- Persists between sessions
- Includes:
  - Default paths
  - Qdrant connection details
  - Batch size preferences
  - Last operation details

## Files Modified

1. **gui/migration_gui.py** - New file (main GUI application)
2. **launch_migration_gui.py** - New file (Python launcher)
3. **launch_migration_gui.sh** - New file (shell launcher)
4. **MIGRATION_GUI_GUIDE.md** - New file (comprehensive guide)
5. **MIGRATION_GUI_QUICK_REF.md** - New file (quick reference)
6. **README.md** - Updated (added Migration GUI information)

## Integration with Existing Tools

The Migration GUI complements existing CLI tools:

### Export Tools
- Uses same logic as `export_to_qdrant.py`
- Produces compatible output files
- Same ChromaDB integration

### Import Tools  
- Uses same logic as `import_to_qdrant.py`
- Compatible with CLI-generated exports
- Same Qdrant client usage

### Benefits of GUI
- Easier for non-technical users
- Visual feedback during operations
- Integrated workflow (export → import)
- Built-in testing and verification
